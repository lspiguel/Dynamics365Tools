# Dynamics365Tools
Some sample code and extensions for Microsoft Dynamics 365 CE

## ChangeActivitiesOwner
This is sample .NET app to search for and change the owner of activities (the actual activity entities should be modified on the code, some are included)
Probably this code would work for other entities other than activities.

## ChangeActivitiesContact
This is Work In Progress, it's not working as of now. The idea was to search for a contact and replace it on activities, the code to handle activity parties is not there yet.

## GetD365Token
Sample .NET console app to get a access token by suplying your credentials. Handy to use it somewhere else, like on SoapUI or a tool to query Dynamics CRM by using ODATA, and where it's harder to get a token.

## PythonSamples
WIP. Sample Python code for handy shortcuts or something. Should grow and expand into a library of sorts. *A reference is WIP too!*
